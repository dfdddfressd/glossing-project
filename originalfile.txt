We are going to gloss an example in {LANGUAGE}. Your task is to predict glosses for the word:

{WORD}

In this sentence:

Sentence: {SENTENCE}
Candidate gloss: {CANDIDATE_GLOSS}
Translation: {TRANSLATION}

Use interlinear glossed text (IGT) and follow the Leipzig glossing conventions.

Glosses should use function tags, not {METALANGUAGE} morphology, to indicate grammatical information: for instance, "monkey-PL" is preferable to "monkeys". Give the best three glosses for the word (in order, best to worst) in a JSON list format outlined below.

{{
  "word": "{WORD}",
	glosses": [
    		"_______",
    		"_______",
    		"_______"
  	]
}}
